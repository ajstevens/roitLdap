roitLdap
This is a simple LDAP library  which we use as part of some tooling. It is mostly meant to 
make LDAP a bit easyer in our tooling. 

The library is now designed around NetIQ eDirectory and has some specific quirks built in, mosty around 
reciplrocal attributes . Most functions should work on most LDAP interfaces.
